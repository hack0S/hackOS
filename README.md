# hackOS
hackOS is a FreeBSD distribution that is **right about to release** for x86.
It is made for replacing a hackintosh, as macOS 26 is the last one to support intel.

## Compatibility
There will be no compatibility with macOS apps for the first release.

## Cosmetics
Not decided yet.

## Release
It is planned to release before **1st of January** as I am a lazy duck.
The beta builds might be based on [helloSystem](https://hellosystem.github.io), but the release should be completely independent.

## Future of the project
hackOS will be updated *probably: if the project won't fail* and i will try to develop my own software for it.
